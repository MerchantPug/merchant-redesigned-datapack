# Merchant Redesigned Datapack
This pack was made for the Origins Discord Classes Jam by MerchantPug, it was made as a proof of concept for what a reworked merchant class could be like, as well as making the merchant class more in my image.

### Installation
Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/MerchantPug/merchant-variant-datapack/releases) and download the two zip files.

Place the datapack in your world's `datapacks` folder or add it upon creating your world to start using it.

Place the resourcepack inside your `resourcepacks` folder in the base Minecraft directory. You will need this (or a server resource pack if you're playing on a server, I will not be covering how to combine resource packs here if you already have a server resource pack, that's up to you.) to play with the datapack, otherwise you will be missing out on a lot of context through textures.

### Origin
#### Merchant | Impact -
**Money Bags**
You are able to craft an emerald pouch which holds emeralds.

**Charisma**
You gain exclusive deals from each type of villager.

### Notes
- The reach for the Anvil Polish only supports the base Enderian origin at this very moment, if you would like to modify the power to support custom origins with modified reach values, please reference the `example-reach-compat` branch (Is yet to be made).
- If you are playing with TooManyOrigins' Undead Origin, install the optional compatibility datapack, otherwise zombie villagers will not keep their data.
- Make sure no Merchant players are near villagers at the time of uninstallation as you will permanently have the unique trades.

### QnA
**Q: Can you backport this to [x] Minecraft version.**
A: This relies on 1.18.2 features to work, so no, I cannot.

**Q: Does this work on Forge?**
A: I haven't tried it, hopefully it does.
