# Merchant Redesigned Datapack
This pack was made for the Origins Discord Classes Jam by MerchantPug, it was made as a proof of concept for what a reworked merchant class could be like, as well as making the merchant class more in my image.

### Installation
Place the datapack in your world's `datapacks` folder or add it upon creating your world to start using it. You will also need the resource pack (or a server resource pack if you're playing on a server, I will not be covering how to combine resource packs here if you already have a server resource pack, that's up to you.) to play with the datapack.

### Origin
#### Merchant | Impact -
**Money Bags**
You are able to craft an emerald pouch which holds emeralds.

**Charisma**
You gain exclusive deals from each type of villager.

### Uninstallation Notes
- Make sure no Merchant players are near villagers at the time of uninstallation as you will permanently have the unique trades.
